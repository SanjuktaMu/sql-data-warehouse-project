# 🏢 SQL Data Warehouse & Analytics Project

Welcome to the **SQL Data Warehouse & Analytics Project** repository! 🚀  
This project showcases the **end-to-end process** of building a modern data warehouse using **SQL Server**, complete with **ETL pipelines**, **data modeling**, and **SQL-based analytics**.



---

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a centralized data warehouse that consolidates data from multiple business sources to enable insightful analytics and reporting.

### 🔍 Objectives:
- Build a scalable data warehouse on **SQL Server**
- Integrate ERP & CRM datasets
- Perform **cleansing, normalization**, and **dimensional modeling**
- Enable business-friendly SQL-based **analytical queries**

---

## ⚙️ Project Requirements

### 🛠️ Data Engineering

**Goal:**  
Develop a modern data warehouse using **SQL Server** that supports analytical queries and business reporting.

**Key Tasks:**
- Import data from ERP & CRM (CSV format)
- Cleanse and standardize inconsistent data
- Integrate data into a **star schema** (facts and dimensions)
- Focus on the **latest dataset** only (no historization)
- Provide clear **documentation** (ERD, data dictionary)

---

### 📊 Data Analysis & Reporting

**Goal:**  
Create actionable SQL-based insights for business stakeholders.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- 🧍‍♀️ **Customer Behavior**: Purchase patterns, segments, engagement
- 📦 **Product Performance**: Top sellers, underperformers
- 💹 **Sales Trends**: Seasonality, revenue analysis, regions

**Deliverables:**
- Analytical SQL queries
- KPIs and metrics
- (Optional) Dashboards in **Power BI** or **Tableau**
- Use case documentation

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Database**: Microsoft SQL Server
- **Languages**: SQL (T-SQL)
- **ETL**: SQL Scripts
- **Data Sources**: ERP & CRM CSV Files
- *(Optional)* Visualization: Power BI / Tableau
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub

## 🏗️ Data Architecture

The data pipeline follows the **Medallion Architecture** with three layers:

![Data Architecture](docs/SQL_DWH_PROJECT.jpg)

| Layer        | Description                                                                 |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Bronze**   | Raw data ingestion from ERP & CRM CSV files into SQL Server                |
| **Silver**   | Cleaned, standardized, and enriched data ready for analytical queries       |
| **Gold**     | Business-ready **fact** and **dimension** tables modeled for reporting      |

---
